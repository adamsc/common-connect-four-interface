The Common Connect-Four Interface
=================================

This is the specification for The Common Connect-Four Interface (CCFI),
a communication protocol to connect a Connect-Four engine and an application.
The CCFI protocol is intended to make communication between engines
and applications as easy and simple as possible. It is currently under development.

This specification is based upon the excellent UCI specification, written by
Rudolf Huber and Stefan Meyer-Kahlen and provided by Shredder Chess.
